##ThinkStats2: Getting Started with Anaconda

The latest version of Anaconda was installed from Continuum Analytics. ([Here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/))
Then the installation was tested by checking the version:

> conda --version

I created a new environment to work with all ThinkStats materials in. 

> conda create --name ThinkStats2
>
>conda info --envs

Lastly, I navigated to the downloaded code and I checked the software according to the text book instructions by running nsfg.py:

> python nsfg.py
